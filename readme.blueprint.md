This mono-repository consists of the following tools:

- [**`vscode-lit-plugin`**](/packages/vscode-lit-plugin) VS Code plugin that adds syntax highlighting, type checking and code completion for lit-html.

- [**`ts-lit-plugin`**](/packages/ts-lit-plugin) Typescript plugin that adds type checking and code completion to lit-html templates.

- [**`lit-analyzer`**](/packages/lit-analyzer) CLI that analyzes lit-html templates in your code to validate html and type check bindings.

- [**`web-component-analyzer`**](/packages/web-component-analyzer) CLI to analyze web components. Used mainly for `lit-analyzer`, and I would recommend looking into the [@custom-elements-manifest/analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@custom-elements-manifest/analyzer) for a tool that complies with the standard Custom Element Manifest instead of using this directly.
